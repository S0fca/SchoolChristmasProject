# Advent of code
## School christmass project in Java
During Christmas break we had to make a project for Information technologies. 

There were different topics to choose from and I chose Advent of Code, where we had to complete 3 days from 2023.  
In order to make it a bit more complex I also added some graphical user interface using Java Swing.
